The present volume is made up of poems from Mr. Carman's three latest
books, <I>The Rough Rider</I>, <I>Echoes from Vagabondia</I>, and <I>April Airs</I>,
together with a number of more recent poems which have not before been
issued in book form.

Bliss Carman: An Appreciation
</H3>

<P>
How many Canadians--how many even among the few who seek to keep
themselves informed of the best in contemporary literature, who are
ever on the alert for the new voices&mdash;realise, or even suspect, that
this Northern land of theirs has produced a poet of whom it may be
affirmed with confidence and assurance that he is of the great
succession of English poets?  Yet such&mdash;strange and unbelievable though
it may seem&mdash;is in very truth the case, that poet being (to give him
his full name) William Bliss Carman.  Canada has full right to be proud
of her poets, a small body though they are; but not only does Mr.
Carman stand high and clear above them all&mdash;his place (and time cannot
but confirm and justify the assertion) is among those men whose poetry
is the shining glory of that great English literature which is our
common heritage.
</P>

<P>
If any should ask why, if what has been just said is so, there has
been&mdash;as must be admitted&mdash;no general recognition of the fact in the
poet's home land, I would answer that there are various and plausible,
if not good, reasons for it.
</P>

<P>
First of all, the poet, as thousands more of our young men of ambition
and confidence have done, went early to the United States, and until
recently, except for rare and brief visits to his old home down by the
sea, has never returned to Canada&mdash;though for all that, I am able to
state, on his own authority, he is still a Canadian citizen.  Then all
his books have had their original publication in the United States, and
while a few of them have subsequently carried the imprints of Canadian
publishers, none of these can be said ever to have made any special
effort to push their sale.  Another reason for the fact above mentioned
is that Mr. Carman has always scorned to advertise himself, while his
work has never been the subject of the log-rolling and booming which
the work of many another poet has had&mdash;to his ultimate loss.  A further
reason is that he follows a rule of his own in preparing his books for
publication.  Most poets publish a volume of their work as soon as,
through their industry and perseverance, they have material enough on
hand to make publication desirable in their eyes.  Not so with Mr.
Carman, however, his rule being not to publish until he has done
sufficient work of a certain general character or key to make a volume.
As a result, you cannot fully know or estimate his work by one book, or
two books, or even half a dozen; you must possess or be familiar with
every one of the score and more volumes which contain his output of
poetry before you can realise how great and how many-sided is his
genius.
</P>

<P>
It is a common remark on the part of those who respond readily to the
vigorous work of Kipling, or Masefield, even our own Service, that
Bliss Carman's poetry has no relation to or concern with ordinary,
everyday life.  One would suppose that most persons who cared for
poetry at all turned to it as a relief from or counter to the burdens
and vexations of the daily round; but in any event, the remark referred
to seems to me to indicate either the most casual acquaintance with Mr.
Carman's work, or a complete misunderstanding and misapprehension of
the meaning of it.  I grant that you will find little or nothing in it
all to remind you of the grim realities and vexing social problems of
this modern existence of ours; but to say or to suggest that these
things do not exist for Mr. Carman is to say or to suggest something
which is the reverse of true.  The truth is, he is aware of them as
only one with the sensitive organism of a poet can be; but he does not
feel that he has a call or mission to remedy them, and still less to
sing of them.  He therefore leaves the immediate problems of the day to
those who choose, or are led, to occupy themselves therewith, and turns
resolutely away to dwell upon those things which for him possess
infinitely greater importance.
</P>

<P>
"What are they?" one who knows Mr. Carman only as, say, a lyrist of
spring or as a singer of the delights of vagabondia probably will ask
in some wonder.  Well, the things which concern him above all, I would
answer, are first, and naturally, the beauty and wonder of this world
of ours, and next the mystery of the earthly pilgrimage of the human
soul out of eternity and back into it again.
</P>

<P>
The poems in the present volume&mdash;which, by the way, can boast the high
honor of being the very first regular Canadian edition of his
work&mdash;will be evidence ample and conclusive to every reader, I am sure,
of the place which
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The perennial enchanted<BR>
Lovely world and all its lore<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
occupy in the heart and soul of Bliss Carman, as well as of the magical
power with which he is able to convey the deep and unfailing
satisfaction and delight which they possess for him.  They, however,
represent his latest period (he has had three well-defined periods),
comprising selections from three of his last published volumes: <I>The
Rough Rider</I>, <I>Echoes from Vagabondia</I>, and <I>April Airs</I>, together with
a number of new poems, and do not show, except here and there and by
hints and flashes, how great is his preoccupation with the problem of
man's existence&mdash;
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">the hidden import</SPAN><BR>
Of man's eternal plight.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
This is manifest most in certain of his earlier books, for in these he
turns and returns to the greatest of all the problems of man almost
constantly, probing, with consummate and almost unrivalled use of the
art of expression, for the secret which surely, he clearly feels, lies
hidden somewhere, to be discovered if one could but pierce deeply
enough.  Pick up <I>Behind the Arras</I>, and as you turn over page after
page you cannot but observe how incessantly the poet's mind&mdash;like the
minds of his two great masters, Browning and Whitman&mdash;works at this
problem.  In "Behind the Arras," the title poem; "In the Wings," "The
Crimson House," "The Lodger," "Beyond the Gamut," "The Juggler"&mdash;yes,
in every poem in the book&mdash;he takes up and handles the strange thing we
know as, or call, life, turning it now this way, now that, in an effort
to find out its meaning and purpose.  He comes but little nearer
success in this than do most of the rest of men, of course; but the
magical and ever-fresh beauty of his expression, the haunting melody of
his lines, the variety of his images and figures and the depth and
range of his thought, put his searchings and ponderings in a class by
themselves.
</P>

<P>
Lengthy quotation from Mr. Carman's books is not permitted here, and I
must guide myself accordingly, though with reluctance, because I
believe that in a study such as this the subject should be allowed to
speak for himself as much as possible.  In "Behind the Arras" the poet
describes the passage from life to death as
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A cadence dying down unto its source<BR>
In music's course,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
and goes on to speak of death as
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">the broken rhythm of thought and man,</SPAN><BR>
The sweep and span<BR>
Of memory and hope<BR>
About the orbit where they still must grope<BR>
For wider scope,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To be through thousand springs restored, renewed,<BR>
With love imbrued,<BR>
With increments of will<BR>
Made strong, perceiving unattainment still<BR>
From each new skill.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Now follow some verses from "Behind the Gamut," to my mind the poet's
greatest single achievement;
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
As fine sand spread on a disc of silver,<BR>
At some chord which bids the motes combine,<BR>
Heeding the hidden and reverberant impulse,<BR>
Shifts and dances into curve and line,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The round earth, too, haply, like a dust-mote,<BR>
Was set whirling her assigned sure way,<BR>
Round this little orb of her ecliptic<BR>
To some harmony she must obey.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
And what of man?
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Linked to all his half-accomplished fellows,<BR>
Through unfrontiered provinces to range&mdash;<BR>
Man is but the morning dream of nature,<BR>
Roused to some wild cadence weird and strange.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Here, now, are some verses from "Pulvis et Umbra," which is to be found
in Mr. Carman's first book, <I>Low Tide on Grand Pré</I>, and in which the
poet addresses a moth which a storm has blown into his window:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For man walks the world with mourning<BR>
Down to death and leaves no trace,<BR>
With the dust upon his forehead,<BR>
And the shadow on his face.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Pillared dust and fleeing shadow<BR>
As the roadside wind goes by,<BR>
And the fourscore years that vanish<BR>
In the twinkling of an eye.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
"Pillared dust and fleeing shadow."  Where in all our English
literature will one find the life history of man summed up more briefly
and, at the same time, more beautifully, than in that wonderful line?
Now follows a companion verse to those just quoted, taken from "Lord of
My Heart's Elation," which stands in the forefront of <I>From the Green
Book of the Bards</I>.  It may be remarked here that while the poet recurs
again and again to some favorite thought or idea, it is never in the
same words.  His expression is always new and fresh, showing how deep
and true is his inspiration.  Again it is man who is pictured:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A fleet and shadowy column<BR>
Of dust and mountain rain,<BR>
To walk the earth a moment<BR>
And be dissolved again.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
But while Mr. Carman's speculations upon life's meaning and the mystery
of the future cannot but appeal to the thoughtful-minded, it is as an
interpreter of nature that he makes his widest appeal.  Bliss Carman, I
must say here, and emphatically, is no mere landscape-painter; he
never, or scarcely ever, paints a picture of nature for its own sake.
He goes beyond the outward aspect of things and interprets or
translates for us with less keen senses as only a poet whose feeling
for nature is of the deepest and profoundest, who has gone to her
whole-heartedly and been taken close to her warm bosom, can do.  Is
this not evident from these verses from "The Great Return"&mdash;originally
called "The Pagan's Prayer," and for some inscrutable reason to be
found only in the limited <I>Collected Poems</I>, issued in two stately
volumes in 1905 (1904)?
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When I have lifted up my heart to thee,<BR>
Thou hast ever hearkened and drawn near,<BR>
And bowed thy shining face close over me,<BR>
Till I could hear thee as the hill-flowers hear.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When I have cried to thee in lonely need,<BR>
Being but a child of thine bereft and wrung,<BR>
Then all the rivers in the hills gave heed;<BR>
And the great hill-winds in thy holy tongue&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
That ancient incommunicable speech&mdash;<BR>
The April stars and autumn sunsets know&mdash;<BR>
Soothed me and calmed with solace beyond reach<BR>
Of human ken, mysterious and low.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Who can read or listen to those moving lines without feeling that Mr.
Carman is in very truth a poet of nature&mdash;nay, Nature's own poet?  But
how could he be other when, in "The Breath of the Reed" (<I>From the
Green Book of the Bards</I>), he makes the appeal?
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Make me thy priest, O Mother,<BR>
And prophet of thy mood,<BR>
With all the forest wonder<BR>
Enraptured and imbued.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
As becomes such a poet, and particularly a poet whose birth-month is
April, Mr. Carman sings much of the early spring.  Again and again he
takes up his woodland pipe, and lo! Pan himself and all his train troop
joyously before us.  Yet the singer's notes for all his singing never
become wearied or strident; his airs are ever new and fresh; his latest
songs are no less spontaneous and winning than were his first, written
how many years ago, while at the same time they have gained in beauty
and melody.  What heart will not stir to the vibrant music of his
immortal "Spring Song," which was originally published in the first
<I>Songs from Vagabondia</I>, and the opening verses of which follow?
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Make me over, mother April,<BR>
When the sap begins to stir!<BR>
When thy flowery hand delivers<BR>
All the mountain-prisoned rivers,<BR>
And thy great heart beats and quivers<BR>
To revive the days that were,<BR>
Make me over, mother April,<BR>
When the sap begins to stir!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Take my dust and all my dreaming,<BR>
Count my heart-beats one by one,<BR>
Send them where the winters perish;<BR>
Then some golden noon recherish<BR>
And restore them in the sun,<BR>
Flower and scent and dust and dreaming,<BR>
With their heart-beats every one!<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
That poem is sufficient in itself to prove that Bliss Carman has full
right and title to be called Spring's own lyrist, though it may be
remarked here that not all his spring poems are so unfeignedly joyous.
Many of them indeed, have a touch, or more than a touch, of
wistfulness, for the poet knows well that sorrow lurks under all joy,
deep and well hidden though it may be.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Carman sings equally finely, though perhaps not so frequently, of
summer and the other seasons; but as he has other claims upon our
attention, I shall forbear to labor the fact, particularly as the
following collection demonstrates it sufficiently.  One of those other
claims is as a writer of sea poetry.  Few poets, it may be said, have
pictured the majesty and the mystery, the beauty and the terror of the
sea, better than he.  His <I>Ballads of Lost Haven</I> is a veritable
treasure-house for those whose spirits find kinship in wide expanses of
moving waters.  One of the best known poems in this volume is "The
Gravedigger," which opens thus:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, the shambling sea is a sexton old,<BR>
And well his work is done.<BR>
With an equal grave for lord and knave,<BR>
He buries them every one.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then hoy and rip, with a rolling hip,<BR>
He makes for the nearest shore;<BR>
And God, who sent him a thousand ship,<BR>
Will send him a thousand more;<BR>
But some he'll save for a bleaching grave,<BR>
And shoulder them in to shore&mdash;<BR>
Shoulder them in, shoulder them in,<BR>
Shoulder them in to shore.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
In "The City of the Sea" (<I>Last Songs from Vagabondia</I>) Mr. Carman
speaks of the seabells sounding
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The eternal cadence of sea sorrow<BR>
For Man's lot and immemorial wrong&mdash;<BR>
The lost strains that haunt the human dwelling<BR>
With the ghost of song.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Elsewhere he speaks of
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The great sea, mystic and musical.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
And here from another poem is a striking picture:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">... the old sea</SPAN><BR>
Seems to whimper and deplore<BR>
Mourning like a childless crone<BR>
With her sorrow left alone&mdash;<BR>
The eternal human cry<BR>
To the heedless passer-by.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
I have said above that Mr. Carman has had three distinct periods, and
intimated that the poems in the following collection are of his third
period.  The first period may be said to be represented by the <I>Low
Tide</I> and <I>Behind the Arras</I> volumes, while the second is displayed in
the three volumes of <I>Songs from Vagabondia</I>, which he published in
association with his friend Richard Hovey.  Bliss Carman was from the
first too original and individual a poet to be directly influenced by
anyone else; but there can be no doubt that his friendship with Hovey
helped to turn him from over-preoccupation with mysteries which, for
all their greatness, are not for man to solve, to an intenser
realisation of the beauty and loveliness of the world about him and of
the joys of human fellowship.  The result is seen in such poems as
"Spring Song," quoted in part above, and his perhaps equally well-known
"The Joys of the Road," which appeared in the same volume with that
poem, and a few verses from which follow:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now the joys of the road are chiefly these:<BR>
A crimson touch on the hardwood trees;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A vagrant's morning wide and blue,<BR>
In early fall, when the wind walks, too;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A shadowy highway cool and brown,<BR>
Alluring up and enticing down<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
From rippled waters and dappled swamp,<BR>
From purple glory to scarlet pomp;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The outward eye, the quiet will,<BR>
And the striding heart from hill to hill.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Some of the finest of Mr. Carman's work is contained in his elegiac or
memorial poems, in which he commemorates Keats, Shelley, William Blake,
Lincoln, Stevenson, and other men for whom he has a kindred feeling,
and also friends whom he has loved and lost.  Listen to these moving
lines from "Non Omnis Moriar," written in memory of Gleeson White, and
to be found in <I>Last Songs from Vagabondia</I>:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is a part of me that knows,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Beneath incertitude and fear,</SPAN><BR>
I shall not perish when I pass<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Beyond mortality's frontier;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But greatly having joyed and grieved,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Greatly content, shall hear the sigh</SPAN><BR>
Of the strange wind across the lone<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Bright lands of taciturnity.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In patience therefore I await<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">My friend's unchanged benign regard,&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
Some April when I too shall be<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Spilt water from a broken shard.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
In "The White Gull," written for the centenary of the birth of Shelley
in 1892, and included in <I>By the Aurelian Wall</I>, he thus apostrophizes
that clear and shining spirit:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O captain of the rebel host,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Lead forth and far!</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Thy toiling troopers of the night</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Press on the unavailing fight;</SPAN><BR>
The sombre field is not yet lost,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">With thee for star.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thy lips have set the hail and haste<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of clarions free</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">To bugle down the wintry verge</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Of time forever, where the surge</SPAN><BR>
Thunders and trembles on a waste<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And open sea.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
In "A Seamark," a threnody for Robert Louis Stevenson, which appears in
the same volume, the poet hails "R.L.S." (of whose tribe he may be said
to be truly one) as
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The master of the roving kind,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
and goes on:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O all you hearts about the world<BR>
In whom the truant gypsy blood,<BR>
Under the frost of this pale time,<BR>
Sleeps like the daring sap and flood<BR>
That dreams of April and reprieve!<BR>
You whom the haunted vision drives,<BR>
Incredulous of home and ease.<BR>
Perfection's lovers all your lives!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
You whom the wander-spirit loves<BR>
To lead by some forgotten clue<BR>
Forever vanishing beyond<BR>
Horizon brinks forever new;<BR>
Our restless loved adventurer,<BR>
On secret orders come to him,<BR>
Has slipped his cable, cleared the reef,<BR>
And melted on the white sea-rim.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
"Perfection's lovers all your lives."  Of these, it may be said without
qualification, is Bliss Carman himself.

No summary of Mr. Carman's work, however cursory, would be worthy of
the name if it omitted mention of his ventures in the realm of Greek
myth.  <I>From the Book of Myths</I> is made up of work of that sort, every
poem in it being full of the beauty of phrase and melody of which Mr.
Carman alone has the secret.  The finest poems in the book, barring the
opening one, "Overlord," are "Daphne," "The Dead Faun," "Hylas," and
"At Phædra's Tomb," but I can do no more here than name them, for
extracts would fail to reveal their full beauty.  And beauty, after all
is said, is the first and last thing with Mr. Carman.  As he says
himself somewhere:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The joy of the hand that hews for beauty<BR>
Is the dearest solace under the sun.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
And again
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The eternal slaves of beauty<BR>
Are the masters of the world.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
A slave&mdash;a happy, willing slave&mdash;to beauty is the poet himself, and the
world can never repay him for the message of beauty which he has
brought it.
</P>

<P>
Kindred to <I>From the Book of Myths</I>, but much more important, is
<I>Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics</I>, one of the most successful of the
numerous attempts which have been made to recapture the poems by that
high priestess of song which remain to us only in fragments.  Mr.
Carman, as Charles G. D. Roberts points out in an introduction to the
volume, has made no attempt here at translation or paraphrasing; his
venture has been "the most perilous and most alluring in the whole
field of poetry"&mdash;that of imaginative and, at the same time,
interpretive construction.  Brief quotation again would fail to convey
an adequate idea of the exquisiteness of the work, and all I can do,
therefore, is to urge all lovers of real poetry to possess themselves
of <I>Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics</I>, for it is literally a storehouse of
lyric beauty.
</P>

<P>
I must not fail here to speak of <I>From the Book of Valentines</I>, which
contains some lovely things, notably "At the Great Release."  This is
not only one of the finest of all Mr. Carman's poems, but it is also
one of the finest poems of our time.  It is a love poem, and no one
possessing any real feeling for poetry can read it without experiencing
that strange thrill of the spirit which only the highest form of poetry
can communicate.  "Morning and Evening," "In an Iris Meadow," and "A
letter from Lesbos" must be also mentioned.  In the last named poem,
Sappho is represented as writing to Gorgo, and expresses herself in
these moving words:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
If the high gods in that triumphant time<BR>
Have calendared no day for thee to come<BR>
Light-hearted to this doorway as of old,<BR>
Unmoved I shall behold their pomps go by&mdash;<BR>
The painted seasons in their pageantry,<BR>
The silvery progressions of the moon,<BR>
And all their infinite ardors unsubdued,<BR>
Pass with the wind replenishing the earth<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Incredulous forever I must live<BR>
And, once thy lover, without joy behold,<BR>
The gradual uncounted years go by,<BR>
Sharing the bitterness of all things made.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Mention must be now made of <I>Songs of the Sea Children</I>, which can be
described only as a collection of the sweetest and tenderest love
lyrics written in our time&mdash;
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">the lyric songs</SPAN><BR>
The earthborn children sing,<BR>
When wild-wood laughter throngs<BR>
The shy bird-throats of spring;<BR>
When there's not a joy of the heart<BR>
But flies like a flag unfurled,<BR>
And the swelling buds bring back<BR>
The April of the world.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
So perfect and complete are these lyrics that it would be almost
sacrilege to quote any of them unless entire.  Listen however, to these
verses:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The day is lost without thee,<BR>
The night has not a star.<BR>
Thy going is an empty room<BR>
Whose door is left ajar.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Depart: it is the footfall<BR>
Of twilight on the hills.<BR>
Return: and every rood of ground<BR>
Breaks into daffodils.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
There are those who will have it that Bliss Carman has been away from
Canada so long that he has ceased to be, in a real sense, a Canadian.
Such assume rather than know, for a very little study of his work would
show them that it is shot through and through with the poet's feeling
for the land of his birth.  Memories of his childhood and youthful
years down by the sea are still fresh in Mr. Carman's mind, and inspire
him again and again in his writing.  "A Remembrance," at the beginning
of the present collection, may be pointed to as a striking instance of
this, but proof positive is the volume, <I>Songs from a Northern Garden</I>,
for it could have been written only by a Canadian, born and bred, one
whose heart and soul thrill to the thought of Canada.  I would single
out from this volume for special mention as being "Canadian" in the
fullest sense "In a Grand Pré Garden," "The Keeper's Silence," "At Home
and Abroad," "Killoleet," and "Above the Gaspereau," but have no space
to quote from them.
</P>

<P>
But Mr. Carman is not only a Canadian, he is also a Briton; and
evidence of this is his <I>Ode on the Coronation</I>, written on the
occasion of the crowning of King Edward VII in 1902.  This poem&mdash;the
very existence of which is hardly known among us&mdash;ought to be put in
the hands of every child and youth who speaks the English tongue, for
no other, I dare maintain&mdash;nothing by Kipling, or Newbolt, or any other
of our so-called "Imperial singers"&mdash;expresses more truly and more
movingly the deep feeling of love and reverence which the very thought
of England evokes in every son of hers, even though it may never have
been his to see her white cliffs rise or to tread her storied ground:
</P>

<P>
O England, little mother by the sleepless Northern tide,<BR>
Having bred so many nations to devotion, trust, and pride,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Very tenderly we turn</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">With welling hearts that yearn</SPAN><BR>
Still to love you and defend you,&mdash;let the sons of men discern<BR>
Wherein your right and title, might and majesty, reside.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
In concluding this, I greatly fear, lamentably inadequate study, I come
to the collection which follows, and which, as intimated above,
represents the work of Mr. Carman's latest period.  I must say at once
that, while I yield to no one in admiration for <I>Low Tide</I> and the
other books of that period, or for the work of the second period, as
represented by the <I>Songs from Vagabondia</I> volumes, I have no
hesitation in declaring that I regard the poet's work of the past few
years with even higher admiration.  It may not possess the force and
vigor of the work which preceded it; but anything seemingly missing in
that respect is more than made up for me by increased beauty and
clarity of expression.  The mysticism&mdash;verging, or more than verging,
at times on symbolism&mdash;which marked his earlier poems, and which hung,
as it were, as a veil between them and the reader, has gone, and the
poet's thought or theme now lies clearly before us as in a mirror.
What&mdash;to take a verse from the following pages at random&mdash;could be more
pellucid, more crystal clear in expression&mdash;what indeed, could come
closer to that achieving of the impossible at which every real poet
must aim&mdash;than this from "In Gold Lacquer" (page 12)?
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Gold are the great trees overhead,<BR>
And gold the leaf-strewn grass,<BR>
As though a cloth of gold were spread<BR>
To let a seraph pass.<BR>
And where the pageant should go by,<BR>
Meadow and wood and stream,<BR>
The world is all of lacquered gold,<BR>
Expectant as a dream.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
The poet, happily, has fully recovered from the serious illness which
laid him low some two years ago, and which for a time caused his
friends and admirers the gravest concern, and so we may look forward
hopefully to seeing further volumes of verse come from the press to
make certain his name and fame.  But if, for any reason, this should
not be&mdash;which the gods forfend!&mdash;<I>Later Poems</I>, I dare affirm, must and
will be regarded as the fine flower and crowning achievement of the
genius and art of Bliss Carman.

Then let me ask you.  Last December, when there was skating<BR>

Hark to our bluebird down in the orchard trolling his chant<BR>

If the toil I give be without self-seeking, bestowed to the limit<BR>

When earth was finished and fashioned well,<BR>
There was never a musical note to tell<BR>
How glad God was, save the voice of the rain<BR>
And the sea and the wind on the lonely plain<BR>
And the rivers among the hills.<BR>
And so God made the marvellous birds<BR>

How rhythm and harmony can mend<BR>
The spirits' hurts and ills.<BR>

To the seraphs' chorus, that we might learn<BR>
The healing of gladness and discern<BR>
In beauty how all is well.<BR>

The bluebird comes with the winds of March,<BR>

We painters sometimes strangely keep<BR>
These holidays.  When life runs deep<BR>
And broad and strong, it comes to make<BR>
Its own bright-colored almanack.<BR>
Impulse and incident divine<BR>
Must find their way through tone and line;<BR>
The throb of color and the dream<BR>
Of beauty, giving art its theme<BR>
From dear life's daily miracle,<BR>
Illume the artist's life as well.<BR>
A bird-note, or a turning leaf,<BR>
The first white fall of snow, a brief<BR>
Wild song from the Anthology,<BR>
A smile, or a girl's kindling eye,&mdash;<BR>
And there is worth enough for him<BR>
To make the page of history dim.<BR>
Who knows upon what day may come<BR>
The touch of that delirium<BR>
Which lifts plain life to the divine,<BR>
And teaches hand the magic line<BR>
No cunning rule could ever reach,<BR>
Where Soul's necessities find speech?<BR>
None knows how rapture may arrive<BR>
To be our helper, and survive<BR>
Through our essay to help in turn<BR>
All starving eager souls who yearn<BR>
Lightward discouraged and distraught.<BR>
Ah, once art's gleam of glory caught<BR>
And treasured in the heart, how then<BR>
We walk enchanted among men,<BR>
And with the elder gods confer!<BR>
So art is hope's interpreter,<BR>
And with devotion must conspire<BR>
To fan the eternal altar fire.<BR>

The sorcery of all the East,<BR>

Who dances up the sun.  She moves<BR>
Like waking woodland flower that loves<BR>

With hollyhocks and salvia.<BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 9em">One day of days</SPAN><BR>
I strolled the silent path that strays<BR>
Between the moorlands and the beach<BR>
From Siasconset, till you reach<BR>
Tom Nevers Head, the lone last land<BR>
That fronts the ocean, lone and grand<BR>
As when the Lord first bade it be<BR>
For a surprise and mystery.<BR>
A sailless sea, a cloudless sky,<BR>
The level lonely moors, and I<BR>
The only soul in all that vast<BR>
Of color made intense to last!<BR>
The small white sea-birds piping near;<BR>
The great soft moor-winds; and the dear<BR>
Bright sun that pales each crest to jade,<BR>
Where gulls glint fishing unafraid.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Here man, the godlike, might have gone<BR>
With his deep thought, on that wild dawn<BR>
When the first sun came from the sea,<BR>
Glowing and kindling the world to be,<BR>
While time began and joy had birth,&mdash;<BR>
No wilder sweeter spot on earth!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
As I sat there and mused (the way<BR>
We painters waste our time, you say!)<BR>
On the sheer loneliness and strength<BR>
Whence life must spring, there came at length<BR>
Conviction of the helplessness<BR>
Of earth alone to ban or bless.<BR>
I saw the huge unhuman sea;<BR>
I heard the drear monotony<BR>
Of the waves beating on the shore<BR>
With heedless, futile strife and roar,<BR>
Without a meaning or an aim.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then a revelation came,<BR>
In subtle, sudden, lovely guise,<BR>
Like one of those soft mysteries<BR>
Of Indian jugglers, who evoke<BR>
A flower for you out of smoke.<BR>
I knew sheer beauty without soul<BR>
Could never be perfection's goal,<BR>
Nor satisfy the seeking mind<BR>
With all it longs for and must find<BR>
One day.  The lovely things that haunt<BR>
Our senses with an aching want,<BR>
And move our souls, are like the fair<BR>
Lost garments of a soul somewhere.<BR>
Nature is naught, if not the veil<BR>
Of some great good that must prevail<BR>
And break in joy, as woods of spring<BR>
Break into song and blossoming.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But what makes that great goodness start<BR>
Within ourselves?  When leaps the heart<BR>
With gladness, only then we know<BR>
Why lovely Nature travails so,&mdash;<BR>
Why art must persevere and pray<BR>
In her incomparable way.<BR>
In all the world the only worth<BR>
Is human happiness; its dearth<BR>
The darkest ill.  Let joyance be,<BR>
And there is God's sufficiency,&mdash;<BR>
Such joy as only can abound<BR>
Where the heart's comrade has been found.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
That was my thought.  And then the sea<BR>
Broke in upon my revery<BR>
With clamorous beauty,&mdash;the superb<BR>
Eternal noun that takes no verb<BR>
But love.  The heaven of dove-like blue<BR>
Bent o'er the azure, round and true<BR>
As magic sphere of crystal glass,<BR>
Where faith sees plain the pageant pass<BR>
Of things unseen.  So I beheld<BR>
The sheer sky-arches domed and belled,<BR>
As if the sea were the very floor<BR>
Of heaven where walked the gods of yore<BR>
In Plato's imagery, and I<BR>
Uplifted saw their pomps go by.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The House of space and time grew tense<BR>
As if with rapture's imminence,<BR>
When truth should be at last made clear,<BR>
And the great worth of life appear;<BR>
While I, a worshipper at the shrine,<BR>
For very longing grew divine,<BR>
Borne upward on earth's ecstasy,<BR>
And welcomed by the boundless sky.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A mighty prescience seemed to brood<BR>
Over that tenuous solitude<BR>
Yearning for form, till it became<BR>

The vision I have tried to catch,&mdash;<BR>
All earth's delight and meaning grown<BR>
A lyric presence loved and known.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
How otherwise could time evolve<BR>
Young courage, or the high resolve,<BR>
Or gladness to assuage and bless<BR>
The soul's austere great loneliness,<BR>
Than by providing her somehow<BR>
With sympathy of hand and brow,<BR>
And bidding her at last go free,<BR>
Companioned through eternity?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So there appeared before my eyes,<BR>
In a beloved, familiar guise,<BR>
A vivid, questing human face<BR>
In profile, scanning heaven for grace,<BR>
Up-gazing there against the blue<BR>
With eyes that heaven itself shone through;<BR>
The lips soft-parted, half in prayer,<BR>
Half confident of kindness there;<BR>
A brow like Plato's made for dream<BR>
In some immortal Academe,<BR>
And tender as a happy girl's;<BR>
A full dark head of clustered curls<BR>
Round as an emperor's, where meet<BR>
Repose and ardor, strong and sweet,<BR>
Distilling from a mind unmarred<BR>
The glory of her rapt regard.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
So eager Mary might have stood,<BR>
In love's adoring attitude,<BR>

Sure in her woman's supersense<BR>
Of things only the humble know.<BR>
My vision looks forever so.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
In other years when men shall say,<BR>
"What was the painter's meaning, pray?<BR>

"What better use for earth and sky?"<BR>

The great archangel passed that way<BR>
Illuming life with mystic ray.<BR>

Upon the purple sea-line leaned<BR>
About that head that intervened.<BR>

Spend without stint the joy and power<BR>
That lurk in each propitious hour,&mdash;<BR>

The shadow of the archway, not the arch,<BR>
Within whose shade at need the poor may rest,<BR>
The weary be refreshed, the weak secure,<BR>
And all men pause to gladden as they go.'"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And Akbar pondered Salim Chisti's words.<BR>
Then turning to his ministers, he said,<BR>
"Here will I build my capital, and here<BR>
The world shall come unto a council hall,<BR>
And in a place of peace pursue the quest<BR>
Of wisdom and the finding out of truth,<BR>
That there be no more discord upon earth,<BR>
But only knowledge, beauty, and good will."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And it was done according to Akbar's word.<BR>
There in the wilderness as by magic rose<BR>
Futtehpur Sikri, the victorious city,<BR>
Of marble and red sandstone among the trees,<BR>
A rose unfolding in the kindling dawn.<BR>
Palace and mosque and garden and serai,<BR>
Bazaars and baths and spacious pleasure grounds,<BR>
By favor of Allah to perfection sprang.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus Akbar wrought to make his dream come true.<BR>
From the four corners of the world he brought<BR>
His master workmen, from Iran and Ind,<BR>
From wild Mongolia and the Arabian wastes;<BR>
Masons from Bagdad, Delhi, and Multan;<BR>
Dome builders from the North, from Samarkand;<BR>
Cunning mosaic workers from Kanauj;<BR>
And carvers of inscriptions from Shiraz;<BR>
And they all labored with endearing skill,<BR>
Each at his handicraft, to make beauty be.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the first ax-blade on the timber rang,<BR>
The timid doves, as if foreboding ill,<BR>
Had fled from Sikri and its quiet groves.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But as he promised, Akbar sent and bade<BR>
The wise men of all nations to his court,<BR>
Brahman and Christian, Buddhist and Parsee,<BR>
Jain and stiff Mohammedan and Jew,<BR>
All followers of the One with many names,<BR>
Bringing the ghostly wisdom of the earth.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And so they came of every hue and creed.<BR>
From the twelve winds of heaven their caravans<BR>
Drew into Sikri as Akbar summoned them,<BR>
To spend long afternoons in council grave,<BR>
Sifting tradition for the seed of truth,<BR>
In the great mosque in Futtehpur at peace.<BR>
And Salim Chisti lived his holy life,<BR>
Beloved and honored there as Akbar's friend.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But light and changeable are the hearts of men.<BR>
Soon in that city dedicate to peace<BR>
Dissensions spread and rivalries grew rife,<BR>
Envy and bitterness and strife returned<BR>
Once more, and truth before them fled away.<BR>
Then Salim Chisti, coming to Akbar spoke,<BR>
"Lord, give thy servant leave now to depart<BR>
And follow where the fluttered wings have gone,<BR>
For here there is no longer any peace,<BR>
And truth cannot prevail where discord dwells."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Nay then," said Akbar, "'tis not thou but I<BR>
Who am the servant here and must go hence.<BR>
I found thee master of this solitude,<BR>
Lord of the princedom of a quiet mind,<BR>
A sovereign vested in tranquillity,<BR>
And I have done thee wrong and stayed thy feet<BR>
From following perfection, with my horde<BR>
Of turbulent malcontents; and my loved dream<BR>
To build a city of abiding peace<BR>
Was but a vain illusion.  Therefore now<BR>
This foolish people shall be driven forth<BR>
From this fair place, to live as they may choose<BR>
In disputance and wrangling longer still,<BR>
Until they learn, if Allah wills it so,<BR>
To lay aside their folly for the truth."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And as the king commanded, so it was.<BR>
More quickly than he came, with all his court<BR>
And hosts of followers he went away,<BR>
Leaving the place to solitude once more,&mdash;<BR>
A rose to wither where it once had blown.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To-day the all-kind unpolluted sun<BR>
Shines through the marble fret-work with no sound;<BR>
The winds play hide and seek through corridors<BR>
Where stately women with dark glowing eyes<BR>
Have laughed and frolicked in their fluttering robes;<BR>
The rose leaves drop with none to gather them,<BR>
In gardens where no footfall comes with eve,<BR>
Nor any lovers watch the rising moon;<BR>
And ancient silence, truer than all speech,<BR>
Still holds the secrets of the Council Hall,<BR>
Upon whose walls frescoes of many faiths<BR>
Attest the courtesy of open minds.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Before the last camp-follower was gone,<BR>
The doves returned and took up their abode<BR>
In the main gate of those deserted walls.<BR>
And in their custody this "Gate of Peace"<BR>
Bears still the grandeur of its origin,<BR>
Firing anew the wistful hearts of men<BR>
To brave endeavor with replenished hope,<BR>
Though since that time three hundred years ago,<BR>
The magic hush of those forsaken streets<BR>
And empty courtyards has been undisturbed<BR>
Save by the gentle whirring of grey wings,<BR>
With cooing murmurs uttered all day long,<BR>
And reverent tread of those from near and far,<BR>
Who still pursue the immemorial quest.<BR>
